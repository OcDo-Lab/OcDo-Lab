## About Me?

I’m a curious, self-taught **scientist** without a **PhD** who loves to learn not by **memorizing**, but by **experimenting**, **exploring**, and **building**. I focus on creating things that are **NEW** and **UNIQUE**, and I enjoy working on projects to improve myself and share with others.
